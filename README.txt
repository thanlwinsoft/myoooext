Myanmar line breaking and spellchecking extension for OpenOffice.org.

This extension uses a combination of a Myanmar Syllable algorithm and a
spellcheck dictionary to identify Myanmar words within a paragraph of text
even if there are no spaces between the words. This information is then
use to line break without needing a space and for spell-checking.

The word list is derived from Dr Judson's Myanmar-Engish dictionary, which
was last revised in 1918, so some updates have been made to spellings. There
will also be new words which have entered the Myanmar language since then.
If you find common Myanmar words, which are being wrongly identified by this
extension please report the issue on http://www.thanlwinsoft.org/.
